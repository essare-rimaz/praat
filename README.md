### Random selector ###

Takes annotated textgrid and the associated sound file from which it selects random intervals. The sound portion of these random intervals is copy-pasted into
a new sound file named 'result'.

The final product is a new sound file with randomly selected intervals from your sound file. The number of intervals so created can be changed as well as well as the layer
of the textgrid from which the intervals are selected.

Useful for testing student ability to recognise segments solely based on spectogram information.
